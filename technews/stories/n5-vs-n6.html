        <div class="jumbotron" id="n5-vs-n6">
        <h4>Old though it might be, the Nexus 5 is still an amazing phone for an amazing price.  Competitors such as the newer Nexus 6 from Google bring competition, but its $649.99 price tag is not affordable for every budget.  On the other side, competitors such as the iPhone 6 and 6+ can give competition, but its $699.99 price tag is ever more expensive!  I belive that the Nexus 5 is still a perfectly good phone, so people should still be buying it.</h4>
